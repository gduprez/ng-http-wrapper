# HttpWrapper

Basic wrapper for angular $http & ng-file-upload Upload services, containing glue code used in all my angular projects.

###Features
- common error handling based on toaster display
- agressive url re-mapping for ASP.MVC based routes
- JWT token based authentication for ADFS authentication to WebAPI
- ... TODO MGA.

###Roadmap
... clean up everything :-)
